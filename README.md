Web Scraping is highly beneficial in extracting
the data and doing analysis on it. Without web 
scraping, the Internet as you know it really 
wouldn’t exist. That’s because Google and other 
major search engines rely upon a sophisticated 
web scraper to pull the content that will get 
included in their index. These tools are what 
makes search engines possible.
